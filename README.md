This is the source code for the Home Quest Decor Helper. You can access the tool at: http://homequestdecorhelper.wuaze.com/?i=1

Future changes planned:
* Import/export in CSV and JSON format.
* Option to only place Valhalla items in the Evergarden if desired. (In progress, logic isn't working correctly as of now)
* Option to choose balanced across towns, rather than working to get one town to the 1000 max before moving on to the next.
